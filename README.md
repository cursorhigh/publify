## 🧩 **1. Problem Statement**

During festivals, emergencies, or large gatherings, public announcements are often delivered in **only one language**, leaving many people confused or misinformed.

This creates:

* Delayed responses
* Panic during emergencies
* Ineffective crowd management
* Communication gaps between multilingual communities

### 🎯 **Goal**

To build a system that can **capture a single spoken announcement**, convert it to **multiple languages**, and broadcast it instantly as **audio + text + video**, across **multiple platforms**, ensuring:

* Safety
* Accessibility
* Inclusiveness

---

## 🚀 **2. Proposed Solution – Publify**

**Publify** is an **AI-powered multilingual announcement platform** built for real-time translation and broadcast.

* High-quality audio delivery

Users can receive announcements across:

1. **Social Bots** (Telegram)
2. **Web Broadcast Dashboard**
3. **Android Mobile App (APK)**

A single announcement becomes accessible to **everyone** — instantly.
